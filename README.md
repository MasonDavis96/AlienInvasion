# Alien Invasion
A clone of Space Invaders. Partially taken from my own work in my game development class, and the other part is from a walkthrough of this exact project highlighting better coding practices<br><br>


# What I Learned
* Best OOP practices<br>
* Better Refactoring habits (creating cleaner/simpler code base)<br>
* Git integration/use with Pycharm<br><br>


# Usage
Run Command:<br>

`python3 alien_invasion.py`<br>
